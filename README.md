# Clipy

Clipy is a browser-hosted environment for writing and running Python code. It combines an editor, an in-browser MicroPython runtime, a terminal UI for stdin/stdout, and authoring tools for tests and automated feedback.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clipy is still very much a work in progress. Features aren't finished. There are still bugs.
> Docs aren't complete. Examples are thin on the ground.

Clipy is a project partly because it's something I really wanted to make, and partly as an exercise in
understanding the capabilities and limitations of agent-directed code. As such I've intentionally tried
to keep my involvement to direction.

This document gives a basic overview of the objectives and technology. You can find documentation here:

## Hosting

Clipy is a static web app. Serve the repository root with any simple static file server and open it in a modern browser. I host it through GitHub Pages but any basic web host should work. Host it on your own computer,
host it on your school web server, etc.

One of the fundamental design intentions for Clipy was that it **must not require anything fancy**. No
Python or JS back-end, no databases. If you can run a web server, you can run Clipy.

## Browser & platform notes

The intention for Clipy is to be a place for students to practice Python in environments where they
might not be able to install a Python distro or bundled IDE, or where a teacher wants to be able to
provide students with integrated problems for students to solve.

- Requires a modern browser with ES module and WebAssembly support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- No server-side runtime is required; the app runs entirely client-side.
- The repository includes a WebAssembly MicroPython runtime in `src/vendor/` used to execute user code in the browser.

## Configuration & authoring

- Configuration is intended to be managed through the in-app Authoring UI (use `?author=true` or the Author page).
- The authoring page allows teachers to create problems for students, define feedback rules to trigger as students write their code, and create unit tests to verify that student code does what it is supposed to.
- Configuration is via JSON files, but the intention is this is all generated by the app.

> [!NOTE]
> The one concession to fiddly web server setup is storing of configuration files. This requires a host that
> permits Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If you want to host files for students to access you
> can either:
> - Store them in the `config` directory of the app; or
> - Store them on a server that allows CORS. If you use the `raw` URL for files in a Github repo, this works
> nicely, so you end up with a URL like `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../your_file_name.json`

## Storage

Clipy uses browser storage for persistence, using IndexedDB (IDB) for the user workspace, code snapshots,
authoring drafts, and more. This means that data persists between browsing sessions (in the same browser,
on the same computer).

Users and authors can also export their work to files on their own computer as needed.
