# This is my personal todo
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Write author documentation
- [ ] Make a logo
- [ ] Make a favicon
- [ ] Dark mode (pretty damned involved - get the agent to build a list of every hard coded colour style first)
- [ ] Reloading the workspace or loading a config should clear files before adding new ones
    - Check whether feedback and tests are being loaded/cleared correct as well, especially if the incoming config has empty arrays for these
- [-] We should be able to mark files in the config workspace as readonly to the user
- [-] Maybe switch to IndexedDB support only - check browser support - localStorage and IndexedDB seem to fight when loading the page and when the reload config button is used
- [ ] New playwrite and other tests
- [-] Continue with the jest tests
- [-] Add the ability to attach files to tests
- [-] Marking code needs to send the user workspace, not just the `main.py` code. Currently trying to read a file in userspace fails because it doesn't get sent for marking
- [-] Tests that always run vs tests that only run if previous passes
- [-] AST support for feedback and tests
- [-] Implement save and restore drafts
- [-] Is there a way of verifying a student has solved a problem in a zero-knowledge way?
- [-] Users can download their workspace as a zip file
