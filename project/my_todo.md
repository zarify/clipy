# This is my personal todo
- [ ] Write user documentation
- [ ] Write author documentation
- [ ] Make a logo
- [ ] Make a favicon
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Maybe switch to IndexedDB support only - check browser support
- [ ] New playwrite and other tests
- [ ] Continue with the jest tests
- [ ] Add the ability to attach files to tests
- [ ] Marking code needs to send the user workspace, not just the `main.py` code. Currently trying to read a file in userspace fails because it doesn't get sent for marking
- [-] Tests that always run vs tests that only run if previous passes
- [-] AST support for feedback and tests
- [-] Implement save and restore drafts
- [-] Is there a way of verifying a student has solved a problem in a zero-knowledge way?
- [-] Users can download their workspace as a zip file
