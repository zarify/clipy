For each file above, add focused subtasks describing recommended tests. Keep tests small and runnable under Jest (jsdom) where possible. Below are recommended subtasks per file.

- src/js/ast-analyzer.js
	- [ ] unit: parse small AST snippets and verify returned analysis shape

- src/js/ast-rule-builder.js
	- [ ] unit: build rules from fixtures and assert expected matcher functions
	- [ ] unit: invalid rule definitions produce helpful errors
	- [ ] integration: combined with `ast-test-builder` to verify rule enforcement on test examples

- src/js/ast-test-builder.js
	- [ ] unit: transform test ASTs into runnable test objects
	- [ ] unit: boundary tests for deeply nested/large ASTs

- src/js/author-feedback.js

- src/js/author-verification.js
	- [ ] unit: correctness of verification algorithm on known-good/bad inputs
	- [ ] integration: wire into zero-knowledge verification stubs to validate expected calls

- src/js/autosave.js

	- [ ] unit: cancel/restore logic when document changes rapidly

- src/js/download.js
	- [ ] unit: blob / data URL creation and filename handling
	- [ ] integration: mock anchor click to verify download trigger

- src/js/editor.js
	- [ ] unit: cursor/selection helpers and serialization
	- [ ] unit: undo/redo buffer behavior (small sequences)
	- [ ] integration: mount editor component in jsdom and simulate basic edits

- src/js/feedback-ui.js
	- [ ] unit: rendering logic given different feedback payloads (errors, hints)
	- [ ] integration: simulate user actions that dismiss/expand feedback and verify state

- src/js/feedback.js

	- [ ] integration: ensure runtime errors produce correct feedback objects

- src/js/input-handling.js
	- [ ] unit: stdin buffering, line-oriented reads, and EOF handling

	- [ ] unit: modal open/close state transitions and focus trapping helpers
	- [ ] integration: keyboard interactions (Escape to close) in jsdom

- src/js/normalize-tests.js
	- [ ] unit: normalization rules for test fixtures and edge cases (duplicate names, missing fields)
	- [ ] integration: verify normalized tests feed into test-runner with expected structure

- src/js/storage.js
	- [ ] unit: read/write/delete operations with a mock backend (IndexedDB/localStorage abstraction)
	- [ ] edge: simulate backend failures and verify retry/failure paths

- src/js/tabs.js
	- [ ] unit: tab activation, close, and reordering logic
	- [ ] integration: assert UI updates in jsdom when switching tabs

	- [ ] integration: run a tiny test suite with a stubbed adapter and assert reporter events

- src/js/traceback_mapper.js
	- [ ] unit: mapping of runtime stack traces to source locations; test with synthetic traces
	- [ ] edge: partial/garbled trace inputs

- src/js/vfs-glue.js
	- [ ] unit: glue layer between runtime FS and host VFS client (path normalization, error translation)
	- [ ] integration: simulate runtime writes and assert host notifications are emitted

- src/js/zero-knowledge-verification.js
	- [ ] unit: verification steps, deterministic outputs for fixed inputs
	- [ ] integration: verify interaction with author-verification and reporter stubs


### Suggested next steps

1. Prioritize `src/js/editor.js`, `src/js/input-handling.js`, and the `test-runner*` files for tests.
2. Add small unit tests first (API surface + edge cases), then add a couple of focused integration tests where necessary.
3. Mark items as done by checking the box when tests are added and committed.
