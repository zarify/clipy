## Jest test progress — snapshot

This note captures the current state of the Jest/jsdom effort so you can pick it up later.

### One-line plan
Summarize what was done, what is green, what remains, and the preferred next steps to finish outstanding work.

## What we implemented
- Set up Jest + jsdom global setup and polyfills to stabilize DOM/localStorage/TextDecoder behaviors used by tests.
- Extracted shared test helpers under `src/js/__tests__/test-utils/` (e.g. `test-setup.js`, `storage-fixtures.js`, `execution-fixtures.js`).
- Converted key singletons into factory-friendly APIs (modules expose `createX(...)` factories while retaining backwards-compatible defaults).

## Tests added (high level)
- Execution-related tests: `src/js/__tests__/execution.test.js` — safety timeouts, asyncify recovery, input fallback, feedback evaluation.
- VFS client tests: `src/js/__tests__/vfs-client.core.test.js`, `vfs-client.init.test.js`, `vfs-client.indexeddb.test.js`, `vfs-client.edgecases.test.js`.
- MicroPython adapter tests: `src/js/__tests__/micropython.test.js` — adapter injection, interrupt API behaviors.
- Storage manager tests (new): `src/js/__tests__/storage-manager.core.test.js`, `src/js/__tests__/storage-manager.quota.test.js`.
- Vendored runtime loader integration test: `src/js/__tests__/loadMicroPython.integration.test.js` (spawn-based, runs a fresh Node ESM process and temporarily stubs `src/vendor/micropython.mjs`).

## Files created or modified (not exhaustive)
- `jest.setup.js`, `jest.config.cjs` — test environment wiring (global setup, jsdom polyfills).
- `src/js/__tests__/test-utils/*` — shared test utilities.
- Multiple `src/js/__tests__/*.test.js` suites (see list above).
- `src/js/__tests__/loadMicroPython.integration.test.js` — spawn/integration test for the vendored loader path.

## How to run the tests (quick)
Use the project's Node and Jest invocation used during development. Example commands used in this work:

```bash
node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand
```

To run a specific test file (example):

```bash
node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js src/js/__tests__/storage-manager.core.test.js --runInBand -i
```

Notes:
- The test suite runs under ESM and uses `--experimental-vm-modules` in local runs.
- Some integration tests spawn a child Node process (the vendored runtime loader test) to avoid ESM mocking/caching issues.

## Status / coverage mapping
- Jest + jsdom harness: Done
- Shared test utilities: Done
- `execution.js`: Good coverage — tests added and passing
- `vfs-client.js`: Good coverage — core/init/indexeddb/edge-case tests added and passing
- `micropython.js`: Adapter and interrupt tests added and passing
- `storage-manager.js`: Basic save/load + quota tests added and passing
- `loadMicroPythonRuntime` (vendored loader): Integration test added (spawn-based) and verified locally; alternative in-process mocking tests were tried but found fragile.

## Outstanding work / recommended next steps
1. Expand `storage-manager` tests
   - Add migration tests for legacy `ssg_files_*` formats.
   - Add tests for `getAllSnapshotConfigs`, malformed JSON handling, and cleanup helpers (`cleanupOldSnapshots`, `cleanupOtherConfigs`, `cleanupAllStorageData`).

2. Harden vendored-runtime tests
   - Current spawn-based integration test is reliable; optionally extend it to assert runtime API behaviors (e.g., call `runPythonAsync`).
   - If you need in-process coverage, consider using Jest's `jest.unstable_mockModule` at the top-level test file before any imports (non-trivial to get right under ESM).

3. Extract spawn/integration helpers to `src/js/__tests__/test-utils/` for reuse when adding more integration tests.

4. Add CI wiring if desired — ensure CI runs Node with ESM support and includes `--experimental-vm-modules` when needed, or adapt tests to avoid that flag for CI stability.

## Quick troubleshooting notes
- If tests read storage/localStorage too early, ensure the Jest global setup (`jest.setup.js`) is referenced in `jest.config.cjs` so the localStorage mirror and `TextDecoder` polyfill are in place before modules import.
- If you see vendored-runtime adapter `null` in tests, prefer the spawn-based integration test approach used in `loadMicroPython.integration.test.js`.

## Resume checklist (what to pick up first)
- [ ] Add migration tests for `storage-manager`
- [ ] Extend `loadMicroPython.integration.test.js` to assert runtime API calls
- [ ] Extract spawn-based helpers to `test-utils`
- [ ] Run full test suite in CI to verify flags and ESM behaviors

## Last-known local test state
- Recent local runs showed multiple test suites passing after the changes (tests added during this session passed locally on macOS development runs).

If you want, I can implement the next item (migration tests for `storage-manager`) now — say “go” and I will add them and run the suite.
